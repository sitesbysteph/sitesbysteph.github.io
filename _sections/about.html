        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Like many of you, I have aspirations to be my own boss. My love for
          autonomy and desire to create is part of the reason I fell in love
          with tech and programming as well.
          <br />
          <br />

          Since 2016, I've worked side jobs helping companies and nonprofits
          maintain their websites by updating code or designing new layouts and
          graphics. In 2018, I started my career as a full time software
          engineer, where I do full stack development to maintain and update a
          suite of web applications. I work mainly in Javascript and Golang
          these days.

          <br />
          <br />

          Working in an enterprise setting has made me realize that I really
          miss the creative process of designing websites for small businesses
          and nonprofits. I love meeting new people and learning about their
          businesses. My goal is to create a website that feels.
