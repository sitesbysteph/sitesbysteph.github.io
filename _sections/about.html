                <p>
                    Since 2016, I've worked side jobs helping companies and nonprofits
                    maintain their websites by updating code or designing new layouts and
                    graphics. In 2018, I started my career as a full time software
                    engineer, where I do full stack development to maintain and update a
                    suite of web applications. I work mainly in Javascript and Golang
                    these days.

                    Working in an enterprise setting has made me realize that I really
                    miss the creative process of designing websites for small businesses.
                    I love meeting new people, hearing their stories and creating
                    websites that reflect their brand. That's why I love freelancing, and
                    I'm excited to use my passion to create your ideal website.
